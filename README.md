\# 🚗 Smart Cruise Control Development Based on TC275DP



\## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on developing a Smart Cruise Control (SCC) system using Infineon's TC275DP microcontroller. SCC is an advanced driver assistance feature that automatically adjusts vehicle speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, enhancing both safety and driving comfort.



\## 🎯 Objectives

\- Implement real-time control logic using TC275DP's TriCore architecture

\- Develop dynamic speed adjustment algorithms based on sensor inputs

\- Maintain safe following distance through automated acceleration and deceleration

\- Validate system performance in simulated and real-world conditions
